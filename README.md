# Robocrop - UI
[Robocrop](https://github.com/yamilelias/robocrop-ui) is part of "Project CH", developed in Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico.

"Project CH" consists of a project whose objective is the creation of an agricultural robot that has the capacities to carry out different activities related to agriculture. The purpose of this robot is to make improvements in the productivity of the person in charge of working the field. The user of the robot can visualize the state of the harvest, as well as other information that is useful to him through the use of technologies. In addition, with these technologies the user will have the ability to take control of the robot to perform other activities.
